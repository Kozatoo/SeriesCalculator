# Series Calculator! 
This is a python project made to implement testing and CI/CD principles we saw in class.

### This app has 3 services: 

A register & login page to ensure authentication & authorization

A calculator page where you insert a number and calculate the n-th element of one of your chosen series 

A summing page that calculates the sum of inserted input or given output related to your account

All your previous calculations can be seen in the dashboard.
